## Introduction
This project is focused on exploring topics around object detection, including experimenting with multiple detection frameworks. The pretext for this exploration is the task of detecting animals in the aquarium, more specifically the [Aquarium Combined](https://universe.roboflow.com/brad-dwyer/aquarium-combined) dataset.


**I describe these experiments and sub-projects on my technical blog: [https://abojda.github.io](https://abojda.github.io).**
